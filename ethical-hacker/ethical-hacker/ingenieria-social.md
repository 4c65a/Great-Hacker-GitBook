# Ingeniería social



Influence, interrogation, and impersonation are key components of social engineering. Elicitation is the act of gaining knowledge or information from people. In most cases, an attacker gets information from a victim without directly asking for that particular information.

How an attacker interrogates and interacts with a victim is crucial for the success of a social engineering campaign. An interrogator can ask good open-ended questions to learn about an individual’s viewpoints, values, and goals. The interrogator can then use any information the target revealed to continue to gather additional information or to obtain information from another victim.

It is also possible for an interrogator to use closed-ended questions to get more control of the conversation and to lead the conversation or to actually stop the conversation. Asking too many questions can cause the victim to shut down the interaction, and asking too few questions may seem awkward. Successful social engineering interrogators use a narrowing approach in their questioning to gain as much information as possible from the victim.

Interrogators pay close attention to the following:

The victim’s posture or body language The color of the victim’s skin, such as the face color becoming pale or red The direction of the victim’s head and eyes Movement of the victim’s hands and feet The victim’s mouth and lip expressions The pitch and rate of the victim’s voice, as well as changes in the voice The victim’s words, including their length, the number of syllables, dysfunctions, and pauses With pretexting, or impersonation, an attacker presents as someone else in order to gain access to information. In some cases, it can be very simple, such as quickly pretending to be someone else within an organization; in other cases, it can involve creating a whole new identity and then using that identity to manipulate the receipt of information. Social engineers may use pretexting to impersonate individuals in certain jobs and roles even if they do not have experience in those jobs or roles.
