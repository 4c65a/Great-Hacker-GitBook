# Clasificacion de ataques

Los distintos tipos de ataques se pueden clasificar en 3 areas principales:

1. **Ataque pasivo**
2. **Ataque activo**
3. **Ataque cercanos**

## **Ataque pasivo**

Passive attacks involve intercepting and monitoring network traffic and data flow on the target network without tampering with the data. Attackers conduct reconnaissance on network activities using sniffers. These attacks are challenging to detect as the attacker has no active interaction with the target system or network. Passive attacks allow capturing data or files being transmitted without the user's consent, such as obtaining unencrypted data, clear-text credentials, or sensitive information for performing active attacks.

**Ejemplos**

* Footprinting
* Sniffing and eavesdropping
* Network traffic analysis
* Decryption of weakly encrypted traffic

## Ataque activo

on the other hand, tamper with data in transit or disrupt communication and services between systems to bypass or break into secured systems. Attackers actively send traffic to launch attacks, which can be detected. These attacks exploit information in transit, penetrating the target's internal network and gaining access to compromise the system.

**Ejemplos**

* Denial-of-service (DoS) attack
* Bypassing protection mechanisms
* Malware attacks (viruses, worms, ransomware)
* Modification of information
* Spoofing attacks
* Replay attacks
* Password-based attacks
* Session hijacking
* Man-in-the-Middle attack
* DNS and ARP poisoning
* Compromised-key attack
* Firewall and IDS attack
* Profiling
* Arbitrary code execution
* Privilege escalation
* Backdoor access
* Cryptography attacks
* SQL injection
* XSS attacks
* Directory traversal attacks
* Exploitation of application and OS software

## Ataque cercano

occur when the attacker is in close physical proximity to the target system or network. The goal is to gather, modify information, or disrupt access.&#x20;

**Ejemplos**

include social engineering techniques like eavesdropping, shoulder surfing, dumpster diving, and other methods.
