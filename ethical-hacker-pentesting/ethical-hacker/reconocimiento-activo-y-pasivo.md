# Reconocimiento activo y pasivo

### _**Reconocimiento activo:**_

Es un método de reconocimiento activo  para reunir información que usualmente se utilizan herramientas ,se envían pruebas a las redes o sistemas en orden de obtener respuestas son estas utilizadas para determinar la posturas de las red o sistema

Estas pruebas pueden utilizar distintos protocolos y multiples niveles de agresividad ,normalmente se basa en que escanea y cuando.

For example, you might be scanning a device such as a printer that does not have a very robust TCP/IP stack or network hardware. By sending active probes, you might crash such a device. Most modern devices do not have this problem; however, it is possible, so when doing active scanning, you should be conscious of this and adjust your scanner settings accordingly.

Common active reconnaissance tools and methods include the following:

* Host enumeration
* Network enumeration
* User enumeration
* Group enumeration
* Network share enumeration
* Web page enumeration
* Application enumeration
* Service enumeration
* Packet crafting

### _**Reconocimiento pasivo**_

is a method of information gathering in which the tools do not interact directly with the target device or network. There are multiple methods of passive reconnaissance. Some involve using third-party databases to gather information. Others also use tools in such a way that they will not be detected by the target. These tools, in particular, work by simply listening to the traffic on the network and using intelligence to deduce information about the device communication on the network. This approach is much less invasive on a network, and it is highly unlikely for this type of reconnaissance to crash a system such as a printer. Because it does not produce any traffic, it is also unlikely to be detected and does not raise any flags on the network that it is surveying. Another scenario in which a passive scanner would come in handy would be for a penetration tester who needs to perform analysis on a production network that cannot be disrupted. The passive reconnaissance technique that you use depends on the type of information that you wish to obtain. One of the most important aspects of learning about penetration testing is developing a good methodology that will help you select the appropriate tools and technologies to use during the engagement.

Common passive reconnaissance tools and methods include the following:

* Domain enumeration
* Packet inspection
* Open-source intelligence (OSINT)
* Recon-ng
* Eavesdropping
