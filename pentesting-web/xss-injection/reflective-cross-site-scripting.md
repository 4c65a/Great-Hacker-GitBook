# Reflective Cross Site Scripting

_**Rcted XSS**_ attacks (that is, non-persistent XSS attacks) occur when malicious code or scripts are injected by a vulnerable web application using any method that yields a response as part of a valid HTTP request. An example of a reflected XSS attack is a user being persuaded to follow a malicious link to a vulnerable server that injects (reflects) the malicious code back to the userâ€™s browser. This causes the browser to execute the code or script. In this case, the vulnerable server is usually a known or trusted site.

**NOTE** Examples of methods of delivery for XSS exploits are phishing emails, messaging applications, and search engines.

Figure 6-18 illustrates the steps in a reflected XSS attack.

The following steps are illustrated in Figure 6-18:

**Step 1.** The attacker finds a vulnerability in the web server.

**Step 2.** The attacker sends a malicious link to the victim.

**Step 3.** The attacker clicks on the malicious link, and the attack is sent to the vulnerable server.

**Step 4.** The attack is reflected to the victim and is executed.

**Step 5.** The victim sends information (depending on the attack) to the attacker.

**TIP** You can practice XSS scenarios with WebGoat. You can easily test a reflected XSS attack by using the following link:

http://**localhost**:8080/WebGoat/CrossSiteScripting/attack5a?QTY1=1\&QTY2=1\&QTY3=1\&QTY4=1\&field1=4128+3214+0002\
\+1999\&field2=111

Replace **localhost** with the hostname or IP address of the system running WebGoat.
