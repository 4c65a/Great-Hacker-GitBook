# File Upload Vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilidades al carga archivos ocurre cuando el servidor web permite subir archivos sin la validación suficiente como el nombre,contenido,tipo y tamaño.

Failing to properly enforce restrictions on these could mean that even a basic image upload function can be used to upload arbitrary and potentially dangerous files instead.&#x20;

This could even include server-side script files that enable remote code execution.

In some cases, the act of uploading the file is in itself enough to cause damage. Other attacks may involve a follow-up HTTP request for the file, typically to trigger its execution by the server.
